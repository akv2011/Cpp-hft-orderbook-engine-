[Project Name]
Final Submission Checklist for High-Frequency Order Book Reconstructor

[Version]
1.0

[Objective]
Complete the final verification, validation, and submission tasks for the High-Frequency Order Book Reconstructor project. Ensure 100% correctness, optimize performance, and prepare all deliverables for submission.

[Key Features & Requirements]

1. **Ultimate Correctness Verification (CRITICAL PRIORITY)**
   * Run comprehensive file comparison between generated `output.csv` and reference `quant_dev_trial/mbp.csv`
   * Use appropriate comparison tools for Windows PowerShell environment
   * Identify and fix any discrepancies, no matter how minor
   * Verify exact match of 5,841 lines with correct formatting
   * Validate price precision, action codes, timestamps, and all numeric values

2. **Special Trade Logic Review and Validation**
   * Verify T->F->C state machine implementation correctness
   * Ensure proper handling of trade sequences where only Cancel action affects order book
   * Validate that F events contain the actual trade size information
   * Confirm correct application of size reduction to OPPOSITE side of book
   * Test edge cases in special trade handling

3. **Output Formatting Corrections**
   * Fix action column to use correct action codes ('A', 'C', 'T') instead of 'S'
   * Ensure 'T' action is properly written for special trade sequences
   * Modify MbpCsvWriter to accept and write correct action from MboEvent
   * Validate all output columns match reference format exactly

4. **Performance Optimization and Measurement**
   * Implement final performance optimizations
   * Measure and document processing time for complete mbo.csv dataset
   * Optimize compiler flags (-O3, -flto, etc.)
   * Document performance metrics and hardware specifications

5. **Code Quality and Documentation**
   * Clean up code with proper comments and structure
   * Ensure consistent coding style throughout project
   * Remove debug code and temporary implementations
   * Validate all header files have proper include guards

[Deliverable Requirements]

1. **README.txt Creation**
   * High-level design explanation (data structures, algorithms)
   * Performance optimizations documentation
   * Special trade logic implementation details
   * Clear build and run instructions
   * Performance metrics and benchmarks
   * Hardware specifications used for testing

2. **Final Executable Generation**
   * Run `make clean` to remove all build artifacts
   * Generate optimized release binary with `make release`
   * Verify executable name follows naming convention
   * Test final executable with provided data

3. **GitHub Repository Preparation**
   * Create private GitHub repository
   * Organize source code files (.cpp, .h)
   * Include Makefile and README.txt
   * Remove temporary files and build artifacts
   * Ensure clean repository structure

4. **Final Testing and Validation**
   * Run complete test suite if available
   * Perform end-to-end testing with provided datasets
   * Validate memory usage and performance characteristics
   * Confirm no memory leaks or undefined behavior

[Critical Success Criteria]

1. **100% Output Correctness**: Generated output.csv must be identical to reference mbp.csv
2. **Performance Target**: Process complete mbo.csv dataset efficiently (target ~220ms)
3. **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented, production-ready code
4. **Complete Deliverables**: All required files and documentation ready for submission

[Priority Order]

1. **HIGHEST**: File comparison and correctness verification
2. **HIGH**: Special trade logic review and fixes
3. **HIGH**: Output formatting corrections
4. **MEDIUM**: Performance optimization and measurement
5. **MEDIUM**: Documentation and README creation
6. **LOW**: Repository preparation and final packaging

[Risk Mitigation]

* If diff check fails, prioritize debugging special trade logic first
* If performance is insufficient, review data structure choices and compiler optimizations
* If build fails, verify Makefile configuration and dependencies
* Have backup testing strategy if automated comparison tools fail
