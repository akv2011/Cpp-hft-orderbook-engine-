When an Add event arrives, check the buffer for a matching `order_id` within a tight microsecond window. If a match is found, consolidate the events, effectively treating it as a modification and suppressing the individual C and A snapshots.\n<info added on 2025-07-30T17:39:44.434Z>\nBaseline test results confirm this task is critical. The current system generates 5,863 snapshots against a target of 3,928, primarily because every 'A' (Add) and 'C' (Cancel) event creates a separate snapshot. Analysis of the reference solution identified 568 specific Cancel-Add (C->A) pairs that are treated as a single modification. Therefore, the successful implementation of this consolidation logic is expected to eliminate approximately 568 'C' and 568 'A' snapshots, directly addressing the root cause of the output count mismatch.\n</info added on 2025-07-30T17:39:44.434Z>",
