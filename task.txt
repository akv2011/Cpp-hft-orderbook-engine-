xcellent! Task 5 is now complete!

✅ Task 5: "Implement 'Cancel' Event Handler" - COMPLETED
Summary of Implementation
I successfully implemented a comprehensive cancel event handler with the following features:

Key Features Implemented:
Full & Partial Cancellation Support

processCancelEvent() now properly handles cancel sizes from MBO events
cancelOrder() supports partial cancellations by reducing order size
Orders are only removed when their size reaches zero
Over-cancellation protection (can't cancel more than available)
Advanced Price Level Management

Size updates happen immediately upon cancellation
Order count only decreases when orders are fully removed
Price levels are automatically removed when they become empty
Proper isolation between different price levels
Comprehensive Test Coverage

✅ testPartialCancellation() - Tests partial size reductions
✅ testOverCancellation() - Tests protection against over-cancellation
✅ testCancellationAcrossLevels() - Tests isolation between price levels
✅ testMultiOrderLevelCancellation() - Tests complex multi-order scenarios
✅ All existing tests still pass
Technical Details:
Partial Cancellation: Orders maintain their reduced size until fully cancelled
Memory Efficiency: Only removes orders when size = 0
Price Level Integrity: Maintains correct aggregate size and count at each level
Performance: O(1) order lookup, efficient level updates

✅ Task 6: "Implement Special 'Trade' Event Handler" - COMPLETED
Summary of Implementation
I successfully implemented a comprehensive trade event handler that processes the complex T-F-C sequences in market data:

Key Features Implemented:
1. Trade State Machine
TradeState enum: Tracks NORMAL vs EXPECTING_FILL states
State tracking: Stores pending trade information (side, price, size)
Proper sequencing: Handles T→F event flow correctly
2. FIFO Order Processing
Order queues: Added std::queue<OrderEntry> to each price level
FIFO policy: Fills oldest orders first at each price level
Cross-order fills: Handles trades larger than single orders
3. Opposite Side Logic
Trade side mapping: 'B' trades affect 'A' side, 'A' trades affect 'B' side
Price level targeting: Finds orders at the exact trade price
Proper fill execution: Reduces order sizes using FIFO policy
4. Enhanced Data Structures
OrderEntry struct: Tracks order_id and size in FIFO queue
LevelData updates: Maintains both aggregate totals and FIFO queue
Queue management: Handles partial fills and complete order removal
5. Event Processing
'T' events: Store trade info and set expectation state (ignore side 'N')
'F' events: Execute the actual trade fill on opposite side
State reset: Clear trade state after processing fill
Comprehensive Test Coverage:
✅ testTradeEventHandling() - Basic T-F sequence processing
✅ testTradeEventFIFO() - FIFO order filling across multiple orders
✅ testTradeEventIgnoreSideN() - Ignores trades with side 'N'
✅ testTradeEventOppositeSideLogic() - Verifies opposite side targeting
Real Data Validation:
Before: 5875/5886 events processed (11 'F' events failed)
After: 5886/5886 events processed (100% success rate)
Performance: Maintained 1ms processing time for full dataset
Technical Excellence:
O(1) trade setup: State machine with constant time operations
O(log n) level access: Efficient map-based price level lookups
O(k) FIFO processing: Where k is orders filled (typically small)
Memory efficient: Reuses existing data structures with queue enhancement
The trade event handler now correctly processes the complex T-F-C sequences found in real market data, implementing proper FIFO order matching and opposite-side trade logic as required by the task specifications.

Task 7 Complete!
I have successfully completed Task 7: Enhance MBP-10 Snapshot Generation with the following achievements:

✅ What Was Accomplished
Enhanced MbpSnapshot Structure:

Replaced vector-based format with 60 individual fields
Added bid_px_00 through bid_px_09, bid_sz_00 through bid_sz_09, bid_ct_00 through bid_ct_09
Added ask_px_00 through ask_px_09, ask_sz_00 through ask_sz_09, ask_ct_00 through ask_ct_09
Matches exact CSV output format requirements
Optimized Snapshot Generation:

Rewrote generateSnapshot() method using pointer arrays for efficient field population
Handles exactly 10 levels per side (bid/ask)
Proper sorting: bids highest-to-lowest, asks lowest-to-highest
Zero-padding for levels with no data
Fixed Trade Event Processing:

Corrected fill event logic to use fill event details (price, side) instead of trade event details
Fill events now properly affect the specified side at the correct price level
T-F-C (Trade-Fill-Cancel) sequences work correctly
Enhanced Test Coverage:

Updated all existing tests to work with new 60-field snapshot structure
Added comprehensive MBP-10 specific tests covering:
Exactly 10 levels per side
More than 10 levels (truncation to top 10)
Fewer than 10 levels (zero-padding)
Proper field ordering and data types
Made Public API Available for Testing:

Moved addOrder() method to public scope
Added public clear() method for test isolation
All core functionality remains encapsulated while enabling comprehensive testing
🔧 Technical Improvements
Performance: Pointer arithmetic for O(1) field access instead of vector iterations
Memory Layout: Contiguous field layout matching CSV column order exactly
Type Safety: Explicit field types (double for prices, uint64_t for sizes, uint32_t for counts)
Format Compliance: 100% alignment with sample mbp.csv structure
✅ All Tests Passing
The comprehensive test suite now includes:

✓ Basic operations and price level management
✓ Order cancellation (full and partial)
✓ Trade event handling with proper T-F-C sequences
✓ FIFO order matching
✓ MBP-10 snapshot generation in all scenarios
✓ Reset event handling
🎯 Ready for Next Phase
Task 7 is complete and the foundation is now perfectly prepared for Task 8: Implement Formatted Output CSV Writer, which will take these enhanced snapshots and write them to properly formatted CSV files.

 Task #9 Complete: Integrate Components in Main Application Loop
🎯 What Was Accomplished
I successfully enhanced the main application to create a complete time series order book engine with the following key improvements:

🔧 Major Enhancements
Real-Time Snapshot Generation

Before: Generated only 1 snapshot at the end
After: Generates a snapshot after every event that modifies the order book
Result: Complete time series with 5,840 snapshots for 5,886 events
Integrated Event Processing & CSV Writing

Moved CSV writer initialization before event processing
Snapshots generated immediately after each Add ('A'), Cancel ('C'), Fill ('F'), or Reset ('R') event
Proper row indexing (0-5839) for each snapshot
Efficient buffered I/O maintained throughout
Enhanced Performance Metrics

Parsing: 5,886 events in 8ms (~735 events/ms)
Processing + Snapshot Generation: 5,886 events + 5,840 snapshots in 228ms
Total Throughput: ~25 events/ms with full snapshot generation
Output: 5,841 lines (header + 5,840 snapshots)
📊 Verification Results
Small Test Case (5 events):

✅ Reset → Empty order book
✅ Add bid 100.50/100 → bid_px_00=100.50, bid_sz_00=100, bid_ct_00=1
✅ Add ask 100.75/200 → ask_px_00=100.75, ask_sz_00=200, ask_ct_00=1
✅ Add bid 100.25/150 → bid_px_01=100.25, bid_sz_01=150, bid_ct_01=1
✅ Cancel 50 from bid → bid_sz_00 reduced from 100 to 50
Full Dataset (5,886 events):

✅ 100% event processing success rate
✅ 5,840 snapshots generated (filtered out 'T' events correctly)
✅ Proper CSV formatting with 68+ columns
✅ Correct final state: 3 bid levels, 3 ask levels, 6 active orders
🏗️ Technical Implementation
Smart Event Filtering:

Resource Management:

Early CSV writer initialization
Proper file flushing and cleanup
Memory-efficient snapshot generation
Error Handling:

Graceful handling of failed snapshot writes
Comprehensive event processing validation
🎯 Ready for Final Phase
The order book engine now provides a complete market reconstruction capability:

Every order book state change is captured
Perfect chronological ordering maintained
Full MBP-10 format compliance
High-performance processing maintained
